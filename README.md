📘 STUDY REPOSITORY – FUNDAMENTALS OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

This repository aims to document the learning process of fundamental programming concepts, with a focus on web development, back-end programming, and the use of Linux as a development environment.

📚 Content

The studies included in this repository cover the following topics:

Java – OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts, control structures, and basic syntax.

JavaScript – Language fundamentals, DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, events, and front-end logic.

Python – Data types, conditional and loop structures, functions, and modules.

C – Program structure, use of pointers, functions, and low-level programming principles.

HTML and CSS – Semantic web page structure and styling with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

Linux – Command-line usage, fundamental commands, filesystem organization, and basic automation in Unix-like environments.

🎯 Objective

The purpose of this repository is to consolidate knowledge through practice, using exercises and simple examples.

At this stage, the development of complete projects is not intended. The primary focus is on the progressive deepening of core concepts related to programming languages and the Linux environment, serving as a foundation for future studies in back-end development, systems, and information security
